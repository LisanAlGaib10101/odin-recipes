        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cranberries</strong>: Fresh cranberries are essential for this sauce, but frozen can work in a pinch.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Granulated sugar adds sweetness to balance the tartness of the cranberries.</li>
            <li><strong>Water</strong>: Water helps create a sauce consistency and cooks the cranberries.</li>
            <li><strong>Orange zest</strong>: Adds a subtle citrus flavor that complements the cranberries.</li>
            <li><strong>Cinnamon</strong>: Optional but adds a warm, spiced flavor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the cranberries under cold water and discard any that are soft or damaged.</li>
            <li>Combine water and sugar in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the cranberries, orange zest, and cinnamon (if using) to the saucepan.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat and let the mixture simmer, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries burst and the sauce thickens (about 10-15 minutes).</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let cool. The sauce will thicken as it cools.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a serving dish and refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
