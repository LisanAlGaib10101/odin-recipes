        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This steak marinade infuses the meat with rich flavor, tenderizing it and enhancing its natural taste. The blend of soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and fresh herbs creates a savory and slightly tangy profile perfect for grilling or pan-searing. Marinate your steak for at least 30 minutes for a deliciously juicy result.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Soy sauce</strong>: Provides a salty, umami base for the marinade.</li>
            <li><strong>Worcestershire sauce</strong>: Adds a depth of flavor with a hint of tanginess.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive oil</strong>: Helps the marinade adhere to the steak and adds a smooth texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Fresh garlic cloves, minced, give a robust aroma and flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh herbs</strong>: Rosemary and thyme work well for a classic steak flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Black pepper</strong>: Freshly ground black pepper adds a slight kick.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional</strong>: A splash of lemon juice or vinegar for added tanginess.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small mixing bowl, combine soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, minced garlic, herbs, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Whisk the ingredients together until well blended.</li>
            <li>Place the steak in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish.</li>
            <li>Pour the marinade over the steak, making sure it is evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or up to 8 hours for a deeper flavor).</li>
            <li>Remove the steak from the marinade and let it sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before cooking.</li>
            <li>Grill or cook the steak to your desired doneness, then let it rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
